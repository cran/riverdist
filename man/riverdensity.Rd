\title{The "riverdensity" Class}
\description{
A class that holds density information computed from point data along a river network.
}
\details{
Created by \link{makeriverdensity} from point data and a river network.  Contains all information for plotting in \link{plot.riverdensity}.
}
\section{Elements}{

 \describe{
   \item{\code{densities}:}{Object of class \code{"list"}. Each list element corresponds to a unique value of survey.  Each element is itself of class \code{"list"}, with each element corresponding to a segment from the associated river network.  Each element is a vector of class \code{"numeric"}, with values equal to the scaled densities calculated at the river network vertices stored in \code{$densverts} of the associated river network segment.}
   \item{\code{endptverts}:}{List of vectors of class \code{"numeric"}.  Each list element is a vector of the vertices of the endpoints of the subsegments considered for density calculation.  Each list element corresponds to a river segment from the associated river network.}
   \item{\code{densverts}:}{List of vectors of class \code{"numeric"}.  Each element is a vector of the vertices of the points of the subsegments considered for density calculation, that were used for density calculation.  Each list element corresponds to a river segment from the associated river network.}
   \item{\code{pointsegs}:}{Vector of class \code{"numeric"}.  Defined as the segment numbers of the point data used for density calculation.}
   \item{\code{pointverts}:}{Vector of class \code{"numeric"}.  Defined as the vertex numbers of the point data used for density calculation.}
   \item{\code{survey}:}{Vector of class \code{"numeric"} or class \code{"character"}.  Defined as the survey identifiers associated with the point data used for density calculation.}
   \item{\code{rivers}:}{Object of class \code{"rivernetwork"} ; see \link{rivernetwork-class}}.
