\title{Create a River Network Object from a Shapefile}
\usage{
line2network(path = ".", layer, tolerance = 100, reproject = NULL,
  supplyprojection = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{File path, default is the current working directory.}

\item{layer}{Name of the shapefile, without the .shp extension.}

\item{tolerance}{Snapping tolerance of segment endpoints to determine 
connectivity.  Default is 100, therefore care should be exercised when 
working with larger units of distance, such as km.}

\item{reproject}{A valid Proj.4 projection string, if the shapefile is to be 
re-projected.  Re-projection is done using \link[sp]{spTransform} in 
package 'sp'.}

\item{supplyprojection}{A valid Proj.4 projection string, if the input shapefile does not have the projection information attached.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{"rivernetwork"} containing all
  spatial and topological information.  See \link{rivernetwork-class}.
}
\description{
Uses \link[rgdal]{readOGR} in package 'rgdal' to read a river 
  shapefile, and establishes connectivity of segment endpoints based on 
  spatial proximity.
}
\note{
Since distance can only be calculated using projected coordinates, 
  \code{line2network()} will generate an error if a non-projected input 
  shapefile is detected.  To resolve this, the shapefile can be re-projected 
  in a GIS environment, or using \code{reproject=}, shown in the second 
  example below.
