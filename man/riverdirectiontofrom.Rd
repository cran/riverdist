\usage{
riverdirectiontofrom(
  seg1,
  vert1,
  seg2,
  vert2,
  rivers,
  logical1 = NULL,
  logical2 = NULL,
  ID1 = NULL,
  ID2 = NULL,
  flowconnected = FALSE,
  stopiferror = TRUE,
  algorithm = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg1}{First vector of river locations (segment component).  These are expressed as rows in the output matrix.}

\item{vert1}{First vector of river locations (vertex component).  These are expressed as rows in the output matrix.}

\item{seg2}{Second vector of river locations (segment component).  These are expressed as columns in the output matrix.}

\item{vert2}{Second vector of river locations (vertex component).  These are expressed as columns in the output matrix.}

\item{rivers}{The river network object to use.}

\item{logical1}{A boolean vector that can be used for subsetting.  If used,
\code{riverdirectiontofrom} will only return directions in which a
specified condition is met for the first dataset.}

\item{logical2}{A boolean vector that can be used for subsetting.  If used,
\code{riverdirectiontofrom} will only return directions in which a
specified condition is met for the second dataset.}

\item{ID1}{a vector of observation IDs for the first dataset that will be used as row names in the output matrix.}

\item{ID2}{a vector of observation IDs for the second dataset that will be used as column names in the output matrix.}

\item{flowconnected}{If \code{TRUE}, only returns distance if the input segments are flow-connected.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{stopiferror}{Whether or not to exit with an error if a route cannot be
found.  If this is set to \code{FALSE} and a route cannot be found,
the function will return \code{NA} in the appropriate entry.  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.  See \link{detectroute}.}

\item{algorithm}{Which route detection algorithm to use (\code{"Dijkstra"},
\code{"sequential"}, or \code{"segroutes"}).  If left as \code{NULL} (the
default), the function will automatically make a selection.  See
\link{detectroute} for more details.}
}
\value{
A matrix of directions (character) with rows and columns labeled by corresponding values of \code{ID}.  See \link{riverdirection} for additional information.
}
\description{
Returns a matrix of directions between each river location in two datasets, with one expressed as rows and the other expressed as columns.
}
\note{
Building routes from the river mouth to each river network segment and/or distance lookup tables will
  greatly reduce computation time (see \link{buildsegroutes}).
