\title{Upstream Distance Between Sequential Observations}
\usage{
upstreamseq(unique, survey, seg, vert, rivers, logical = NULL,
  flowconnected = FALSE, net = FALSE, stopiferror = TRUE,
  algorithm = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{unique}{A vector of identifiers for each fish.}

\item{survey}{A vector of identifiers for each survey.  It is recommended to use a numeric or date format (see \link{as.Date}) to preserve survey order.}

\item{seg}{A vector of river locations (segment component).}

\item{vert}{A vector of river locations (vertex component).}

\item{rivers}{The river network object to use.}

\item{logical}{A boolean vector that can be used for subsetting - if used,
\code{upstreamseq()} will only return pairwise distances in which a
specified condition is met.}

\item{flowconnected}{If \code{TRUE}, only returns distance if the input segments are flow-connected.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{net}{Whether to calculate net upstream distance (net=TRUE) or total
distance (net=FALSE, default).}

\item{stopiferror}{Whether or not to exit with an error if a route cannot be
found.  If this is set to \code{FALSE} and a route cannot be found,
the function will return \code{NA} in the appropriate entry.  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.  See \link{detectroute}.}

\item{algorithm}{Which route detection algorithm to use (\code{"Dijkstra"},
\code{"sequential"}, or \code{"segroutes"}).  If left as \code{NULL} (the
default), the function will automatically make a selection.  See
\link{detectroute} for more details.}
}
\value{
A data frame of upstream distances (numeric), with rows defined by
  unique fish and columns defined by observation increment (1 to 2, 2 to 3,
  etc.)  See \link{upstream} for additional information.
}
\description{
Returns a matrix of distance with direction by unique fish
  between sequential surveys.  The mouth (lowest point) segment and vertex
  must be specified (see \link{setmouth}).  A plotting method is provided for the output; see \link{plotseq}.
}
\note{
Returns either net upstream distance (net=TRUE) or total distance
  (net=FALSE, default).  See \link{upstream}.

Building routes from the river mouth to each river network segment may
  greatly reduce computation time (see \link{buildsegroutes}).

\examples{
data(Gulk, fakefish)

# Mouth must be specified
Gulk$mouth$mouth.seg <- 1
Gulk$mouth$mouth.vert <- 1

upstreamseq(unique=fakefish$fish.id, survey=fakefish$flight, seg=fakefish$seg,
      vert=fakefish$vert, rivers=Gulk)

seqbysurvey <- upstreamseq(unique=fakefish$fish.id, survey=fakefish$flight.date, seg=fakefish$seg,
      vert=fakefish$vert, rivers=Gulk)
seqbysurvey
