\title{Check for Braiding in a River Network}
\usage{
checkbraided(rivers, startseg = NULL, endseg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rivers}{The river network object to check.}

\item{startseg}{Starting segment of a route to investigate.  If this and
\code{endseg} are \code{NULL}, the full river network will be checked.}

\item{endseg}{Starting segment of a route to investigate.  If this and
\code{startseg} are \code{NULL}, the full river network will be checked.}
}
\description{
Detects braiding (multiple flow channels between two locations)
  within a river network object.  Braiding can either be checked for in the
  route between two segments, or in the river network as a whole.
}
\note{
This function is called within \link{cleanup}, which is recommended in most cases.
