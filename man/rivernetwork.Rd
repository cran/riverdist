\title{The "rivernetwork" Class}
\description{
A class that holds spatial coordinates for river networks, as well as network topology and attributes.
}
\details{
Created by \link{line2network} from an input line shapefile.  Contains all information for network distance calculation, plotting, etc. in the 'riverdist' package.

Plotting methods are described in \link{plot.rivernetwork}.
}
\section{Elements}{
 
 \describe{
   \item{\code{sp}:}{Object of class \code{"SpatialLinesDataFrame"} from package 'sp'; see \link[sp]{SpatialLinesDataFrame-class}.  This is the original object as read by \link[rgdal]{readOGR}, and is preserved to maintain plotting capability.}
   \item{\code{lines}:}{Object of class \code{"list"}.  Each list element is a matrix of XY coordinates of the vertices of a single river segment.}
   \item{\code{connections}:}{Object of class \code{"matrix"}, with \code{"numeric"} elements.  Defined as a square matrix, with elements describing the type of connection detected between line segments.
     \itemize{
     \item A value of 1 in element \code{[i,j]} indicates that the beginning of segment \code{i} is connected to the beginning of segment \code{j}.
     \item A value of 2 in element \code{[i,j]} indicates that the beginning of segment \code{i} is connected to the end of segment \code{j}.
     \item A value of 3 in element \code{[i,j]} indicates that the end of segment \code{i} is connected to the beginning of segment \code{j}.
     \item A value of 4 in element \code{[i,j]} indicates that the end of segment \code{i} is connected to the end of segment \code{j}.
     \item A value of NA in element \code{[i,j]} indicates that segments \code{i} and \code{j} are not connected.}}
   \item{\code{lengths}:}{Vector of class \code{"numeric"}.  Defined as the calculated total lengths of each river segment.}
   \item{\code{names}:}{Vector of class \code{"character"}.  Defined as the names of each river segment.}
   \item{\code{mouth}:}{Object of class \code{"list"}, with two elements.  Element \code{mouth.seg} gives the segment number of the mouth (lowest point) of the river network, and \code{mouth.vert} gives the vertex number.}
   \item{\code{sequenced}:}{\code{"logical"}: has value of TRUE if line vertices have been stored in upstream sequence using \link{sequenceverts}.}
   \item{\code{tolerance}:}{\code{"numeric"}: the spatial tolerance that was used in determining river segment endpoint connectivity; see \link{line2network}, \link{splitsegments}.}
   \item{\code{units}:}{\code{"character"}: the spatial units detected from the input shapefile.}
   \item{\code{lineID}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame"} establishing the relationship between river segments as stored in the \code{sp} and \code{lines} elements, and is used for updating the \code{sp} element during river network editing in \link{dissolve}, \link{splitsegments}, \link{sequenceverts}, \link{trimriver}, and \link{trimtopoints}.
   \itemize{
     \item \code{rivID} gives the list element number of each river segment in \code{lines}.  This is the same number that is used for segment numbering in river locations.
     \item \code{sp_line} gives the corresponding list element in \code{sp@lines}.
     \item \code{sp_seg} gives the corresponding list element in \code{sp@lines[[]]@Lines}.
     }}
   \item{\code{segroutes}:}{Object of class \code{"list"}, with each element defined as a vector of class \code{"numeric"}, describing the route from the mouth segment to the specific segment.  This element only exists if \link{buildsegroutes} has been run, and can greatly speed up route and distance calculation.}
   \item{\code{braided}:}{\code{"logical"}: Has value of \code{TRUE} if \link{checkbraidedTF} has detected braiding, \code{FALSE} if no braiding has been detected, and \code{NA} if braiding has not yet been checked.}
