\title{Trim a River Network to a Set of X-Y Coordinates}
\usage{
trimtopoints(x, y, rivers, method = "snap", dist = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of x-coordinates of point data to buffer around}

\item{y}{Vector of y-coordinates of point data to buffer around}

\item{rivers}{The river network object to use}

\item{method}{Three methods are available.  If \code{"snap"} is specified
(the default), only the closest segment to each point is retained.   If
\code{"snaproute"} is specified, segments are also retained that will
maintain total connectivity in the resulting river network.  If
\code{"buffer"} is specified, all segments with endpoints or midpoints
within \code{dist} units of the input locations are retained.}

\item{dist}{Distance to use for buffering, if \code{method="buffer"}.  If
this is not specified, the maximum spread in the x- and y- direction will
be used.}
}
\value{
A new river network object (see \link{rivernetwork})
}
\description{
Removes line segments from a river network object that are not
  adjacent to a set of point data, given in X-Y coordinates.
}
\note{
If \code{method=="buffer"}, only distances to segment endpoints 
  and midpoints are checked, and still only whole segments are removed.
